hey, i'm debjit 👋

just a second-year engineering student trying to figure things out.

🌱 about me

I like learning things the hard way — by trying, failing, fixing, and trying again 😅. I’m into AI, generative stuff, and tech in general, but honestly I’m still exploring and learning every day.

some days I’m super motivated 🚀, some days I’m just confused staring at code for hours… but I keep going.

🧠 things i’m into

🤖 ai & generative ai (still learning, always curious)

💻 coding and building random things

🌐 web stuff & APIs

🧩 problem solving (when my brain cooperates)



---

🍳🎬 life outside code

🍳 i really like cooking (experimenting > recipes)

🍜 food makes everything better

🎬 i watch anime a lot (story > action for me)

🌙 late nights thinking about life & future



---

📖 how i learn (most of the time)

try → fail → google → try again

build first, understand later

consistency over motivation (still working on this 😬)
